# substrate-contracts-node
substrate-contracts-node template for developing/running ink! based smart contracts. I tried to add the Contracts pallet to my node2 node template, but apparently it's not as straightforward to add the Contracts pallet to your runtime as it is for other pallets so I'm using the template instead.
